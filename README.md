# Algolab 2021
My code for the problems given in the ETH course [Algorithms Lab in Fall 2021](https://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS21/algolab/index.html). Problems descriptions and testcases not included. I did not put as much effort into this as [this guy](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/algolab-2020) did, but I took some inspiration :)
