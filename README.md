# Algolab 2021
My code for the problems given in the ETH course [Algorithms Lab in Fall 2021](https://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS21/algolab/index.html). Problems descriptions and testcases not included. I did not put as much effort into this as [this guy](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/algolab-2020) did, but I took some inspiration :) Also credits to the creators of the [algolabVS.sh](algolabVS.sh) with which this stuff was done (+ Code Expert).

Code requires C++, CGAL, BGL. See https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS21/algolab/technical.html.

E.g. on Ubuntu, run
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libcgal-dev cmake cmake-data
```
